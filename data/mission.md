with the principles of open science.

More specifically, we:

* apply AI to improve ways in which research is conducted;
* develop novel technologies enabling systematic analysis of 
  research data and  literature;
* create services to improve access to scientific information for all
* do research on research;
* support the transition to and raise awareness of the benefits
  of open research;
* work with companies to help them derive value from research data 
  and scientific information in areas as diverse as analysing trends, 
  detecting misinformation and plagiarism detection.
